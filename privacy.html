<h1>Privacy Policy – DadProof</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: November 18, 2025</strong></p>

<p>DadProof ("we", "our", or "us") is a family calendar mobile app designed to help parents never forget pickups or appointments. We take your privacy extremely seriously — especially since this app is used by families and children.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address and password (hashed) when you create an account.</li>
  <li><strong>Family Data:</strong> Names, colors, and calendar events you choose to add (pickups, appointments, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Push Tokens:</strong> Device tokens required to send reminders (Expo push service).</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Handled entirely by Stripe — we never see or store your credit card.</li>
  <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> Only if you enable "Pickup Mode" geofencing, and only foreground location while the app is open.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>Only to:
- Show your family calendar
- Send you reminders and "nuke" alerts
- Process payments via Stripe
- Improve the app (anonymized analytics)</p>

<h2>3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No advertising ID tracking</li>
  <li>No selling data</li>
  <li>No third-party analytics that track you across apps</li>
  <li>No children’s data collected without parental consent (the app is for parents only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<p>All data is stored securely on Supabase (EU/US servers) with encryption at rest and in transit. We use Row Level Security so you can only see your own family’s data.</p>

<h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
<p>We share data only with:
- Stripe (payments)
- Expo (push notifications)
- Subprocessors listed at https://dadproof.app/subprocessors (we’ll create this later)</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You can delete your account and all data at any time from Settings → "Delete Account". All data is permanently removed within 24 hours.</p>

<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
<p>Email: hello@dadproof.app</p>

<p>Thank you for trusting DadProof with your family’s schedule ❤️</p>
