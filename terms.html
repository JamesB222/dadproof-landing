<h1>Terms of Service – DadProof</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: November 18, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
<p>By using DadProof, you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree, please don’t use the app.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>DadProof is a shared family calendar with aggressive reminders designed to help parents (especially dads) never forget school pickups or appointments.</p>

<h2>3. Pricing & Payments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Free tier: Limited features</li>
  <li>Premium: $11.99/month or $99/year (auto-renewing)</li>
  <li>Refunds: Within 14 days via Apple/Google or contact us</li>
  <li>All payments processed securely by Stripe</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Account Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your password secure and all activity on your account.</p>

<h2>5. Prohibited Use</h2>
<p>No commercial use, no reverse-engineering, no being a jerk in any shared family (kidding on the last one — but seriously, be nice).</p>

<h2>6. Termination</h2>
<p>We can suspend or terminate accounts for violations. You can delete your account anytime.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>We’re not responsible if you still forget pickup because your phone was on silent (but we’ll do our absolute best). The app is provided "as-is" without warranties.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We’ll notify you of major changes via email or in-app notice.</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>hello@dadproof.app</p>

<p>Thanks for using DadProof — now go be an awesome parent!</p>
